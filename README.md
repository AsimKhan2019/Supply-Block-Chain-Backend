# Supply BlockChain_Backend
The purpose of this project is to see how BlockChain can be used in Supply Chain Management. This project implements a simple manufacturing supply chain in the form of a blockchain. All stages involved in the life cycle of a product from manufacturing till it reaches consumer are stored on the blockchain. 

This is the backend of the system which manages Supply BlockChain, all type of operations on Supply Blockchain are performed in Backend Module. Backend Module is implemented in ASP.NET Core WebApp which exposes REST APIs to perform all operations on the Supply BlockChain. These APIs are consumed by Frontend App https://github.com/sudesh1611/SupplyBlockChainApp
